I am a Senior Research Scientist in the Oxford Applied Research Team of <a href="https://www.five.ai" target="_blank">Five AI</a> (which has been acquired by Bosch). Our main mission is to help building the technology to enable driverless cars. Towards this aim, I have been closely working with <a href="https://puneetkdokania.github.io" target="_blank">Puneet Dokania</a> to develop accurate and robust computer vision algorithms.

Previously, I received my M.Sc. in 2016 from <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr" target="_blank">Dept. of Computer Engineering</a>, <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index" target="_blank">Bogazici University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Ali Taylan Cemgil</a> and my Ph.D. degree in 2021 from <a href="https://ceng.metu.edu.tr" target="_blank">Dept. of Computer Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.metu.edu.tr" target="_blank">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Sinan Kalkan</a> and <a href="http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~emre/" target="_blank">Asst. Prof. Emre Akbaş</a>.
