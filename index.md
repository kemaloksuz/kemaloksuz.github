I have received my B.Sc. degree from the Land Forces Academy of Turkey in 2008 and M.Sc. in 2016 from <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr" target="_blank">Computer Engineering Department</a>, <a href="http://www.boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index" target="_blank">Bogazici University</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cemgil/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Ali Taylan Cemgil</a>. I have received my Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.metu.edu.tr" target="_blank">Middle East Technical University</a> in <a href="https://ceng.metu.edu.tr" target="_blank">Department of Computer Engineering</a> in 2021 under the supervision of <a href="http://www.kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~sinan/" target="_blank">Assoc. Prof. Sinan Kalkan</a> and <a href="http://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~emre/" target="_blank">Asst. Prof. Emre Akbaş</a>. Currently, I am working for <a href="https://www.tsk.tr/HomeEng" target="_blank">Turkish Armed Forces</a>. I am also a research associate at <a href="https://image.ceng.metu.edu.tr" target="_blank">Image Lab</a>, METU. My research interests include computer vision with a focus on visual detection (including segmentation), imbalance problems and nondiffererentiable optimization (mainly ranking).

<h1>Recent News</h1> 
**July 2021** - Our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11669" target="_blank"> Rank & Sort Loss for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation</a>, has been accepted to ICCV 2021 for oral presentation. The code is available in our <a href="https://github.com/kemaloksuz/RankSortLoss" target="_blank">project page</a>.<br /> 
**May 2021** - I have successfully defended my PhD Thesis titled Identifying and Addressing Imbalance Problems in Visual Detection. Due to an ongoing double blind review process, it will be public in short. <br /> 
**December 2020** - I gave a talk (in Turkish) about aLRP Loss in <a href="https://inzva.com/ai/meetups/2020/neurips-meetup-turkey-2020" target="_blank">NeurIPS Meetup Turkey</a>. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M4k4ILdzvg" target="_blank">talk</a> and  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_u0_sjK2FcGJZYQWY3PNPeybclAOf-_/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">slides</a>. <br />

</a>, is online! This paper extends the LRP Error, previosly published in ECCV 2018, to *all* visual detection tasks. You can find the implementation of LRP Error on commonly used datasets (COCO, LVIS and Panoptic-COCO) in our <a href="https://github.com/kemaloksuz/LRP-Error" target="_blank">project page</a>.<br /> 
**September 2020** - Our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13592" target="_blank">A Ranking-based, Balanced Loss Function Unifying Classification and Localisation in Object Detection</a>, has been accepted to NeurIPS 2020 as a spotlight. The code is available in our <a href="https://github.com/kemaloksuz/aLRPLoss" target="_blank">project page</a>.<br /> 
**August 2020** - In our Workshop on Imbalance Problems on Computer Vision, ECCV 2020, I gave a talk on Imbalance Problems in Object Detection including problem definitions, common methods and current trends.
